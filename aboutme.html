  <h1>Hi, I'm Briana.</h1>

  <p>Musician, teacher, animal-lover, and coder.</p>

  <p id="aboutme">
    Let's cut to the chase, shall we? Why am I, a K-2 music teacher in Illinois, spending her time and energy learning to code (and ultimately to program)? Well, after completing my degree and finding a job in my field, I started to miss math class and my old fun hobby of basic web design, circa middle school. Ultimately, I'm looking for a path that offers me flexible hours, the option to work from home, and improve my pay. Cheers!

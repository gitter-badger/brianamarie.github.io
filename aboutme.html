  <h1>Hi, I'm Briana.</h1>

  <p>Musician, teacher, animal lover, and coder.</p>

  <p id="aboutme">
    Let's cut to the chase, shall we? Why am I, a K-2 music teacher in Illinois, spending her time and energy learning to code (and ultimately to program)? Well, after completing my degree and finding a job in my field, it occured to me that I'd gone to school for something I didn't want a career in.  I'm looking for a career that offers me flexible hours, the option to work from home, and more pay than a teacher gets. Cheers!
